# E-Commerce Sales & Customer Feedback Analytics (SQL)

**MS Data Analytics student at Touro University**

This project analyzes e-commerce sales and customer feedback data using SQL to generate actionable business insights. The goal is to demonstrate relational database design, SQL querying skills, and data-driven decision-making by transforming raw transactional data into meaningful performance metrics and insights.

## Business Problems Addressed

The analysis focuses on answering these key business questions:
- How does customer feedback influence product performance and sales?
- Which products generate the highest revenue and sales volume?
- How can customer purchase behavior identify high-value customers?
- How can SQL automation support KPI reporting and performance tracking?

## Objectives

- Design a normalized relational database for e-commerce data
- Perform SQL-based sales and feedback analysis
- Create reusable views and stored procedures
- Translate analytical results into business recommendations

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Relational database design with ER modeling
- Advanced SQL queries using JOINs, aggregations, GROUP BY, and CASE statements
- Sales trend analysis and top-selling product identification
- Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior and engagement
- Stored procedures for automated KPI reporting
- Business insight generation from structured data

## Database Design

**Core Tables:**
- **Customers** – customer profile and registration data
- **Products** – product catalog and pricing
- **Sales** – transactional sales records
- **Feedback** – customer ratings and reviews

An **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** illustrates table relationships and keys.

## Key Analyses Performed

**Customer Purchase Summary**
- Calculates total orders and total spending per customer
- Identifies high-value customers for loyalty strategies

**Product Rating Analysis**
- Computes average product ratings and total reviews
- Highlights high-rated and low-rated products

**Product Performance Classification**
- Uses CASE statements to classify products as Excellent, Good, Average, or Poor

**Sales Trend Analysis**
- Aggregates daily revenue to track sales trends
- Identifies peak sales periods

**Top-Selling Products**
- Identifies top products by revenue and units sold

**Automation & KPI Reporting**
- Stored procedures for product performance reports
- Automated total revenue KPIs over time ranges

## Key Business Insights

- High-rated products aren't always top sellers → promotion opportunities
- Customer segmentation enables targeted marketing
- Automated KPI reporting improves efficiency
- Sales trend analysis supports inventory planning

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** (JOINs, aggregations, CASE statements, subqueries)
- **Relational Database Design** (ER modeling)
- **Stored Procedures & Views**
- Sales and customer feedback analytics
